# 👋 Hi, I’m Sam

I’m a Backend Engineer with over **X years** of professional experience building scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems. My core expertise lies in **Java (Spring Boot)**, REST API design, microservice architecture, and DevOps practices for reliable deployment pipelines.

I have delivered production-grade systems in domains like **e-commerce, finance, and enterprise platforms**, working across the entire SDLC — from planning and development to CI/CD and monitoring.

I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, following SOLID principles, and automating workflows to improve development efficiency.
